## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ”­Throughout my life I have developed a great passion for mathematics, standing out academically during my school years.
As I have been researching and investigating the different areas of engineering, I have realized that technology is advancing by leaps and bounds, with many challenges ahead for the world and I would like to be part of that future.
I am currently studying industrial civil engineering and computer civil engineering, which are two areas that I know will take me to the future that I hope for.ğŸ˜„
